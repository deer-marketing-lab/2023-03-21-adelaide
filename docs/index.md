# Welcome!

Welcome to the course website for the **text as data** workshop in the Marketing Group at Adelaide Business School in March 2023.

This course introduces students to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to analyze text - with an emphasis on "doing" analysis using the `R` programming language.
We assume that attendees have no previous experience with NLP tools.
The workshop will be "hands-on", with a mix of live coding that you can follow along with, and some short exercises (time permitting).

See the [Installation Guide](installation.md) and [Course Material](course_material.md) tabs for the learning materials.
