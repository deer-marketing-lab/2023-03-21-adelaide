They're bad because they aren\u2019t helpful, break the flow of conversation, and focus attention on the person making the well actually.</p> <p>This rule can be a bit tricky because there isn't a clear line between relevant to the conversation and not. Sometimes your correction might actually be necessary, and it could still come off as annoying when you make it.  The best rule of thumb is, if you\u2019re not sure whether something needs to be said right now, hold off and see what happens.

When someone acts surprised when you don't know something, it doesn't matter whether they're pretending to be surprised or actually surprised.  The effect is the same: the next time you have a question, you\u2019re more likely to keep your mouth shut.

Because you haven't been participating in the conversation, it\u2019s easy to miss something important and give advice that\u2019s not actually helpful. Even if your advice is correct, it's rude to bust into a conversation without asking. If you overhear a conversation where you could be helpful, the best thing to do is to ask to join.</p>"},{"location":"conduct/social_rules/#no-subtle-isms","title":"No subtle -isms","text":"<p>Carol: Windows is hard to use.</p> <p>Bob: No way. Windows is so easy to use that even my mom can use it.</p> <p>Subtle -isms are subtle expressions of racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia and other kinds of bias and prejudice. They are small things that make others feel unwelcome, things that we all sometimes do by mistake. Subtle -isms make people feel like they don\u2019t belong at in our learning environment. We want to create an environment where everyone can focus all their energy on learning. That is hard to do that if you're regularly being made to wonder whether you belong.</p> <p>Subtle -isms can also be things that you do instead of say.  This includes things like boxing out the only woman at the whiteboard during a discussion or assuming someone isn't a good coder because of their race or gender.</p> <p>The fourth social rule is more complicated than the others.  Not everyone agrees on what constitutes a subtle -ism. Subtle -isms are baked into society in ways that can make them hard to recognize.  And not everyone experiences subtle -isms in the same way: subtle homophobia won\u2019t hurt someone who's straight in the same way it hurts someone who's gay.</p> <p>There's another part of no subtle -isms:  If you see racism, sexism, etc. outside of our class, please don't bring it in. For example, please don\u2019t start a discussion about the latest offensive comment from Random Person Y.  Everyone who comes to our class should have the same opportunity to focus on learning, and people from oppressed groups often find discussions of racism, sexism, etc. particularly hard to tune out.
